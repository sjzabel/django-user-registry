This provides a UserRegistry and UserRegistryMiddleware classes

Add the middleware to your list of middlewares; make sure it is added after the AuthenticationMiddleware

In model or signal code you can now access the UserRegistery class to see if an authenticated user exists and if so, be able to use that user.
